**Automatic printing for Shopify using the WooPrinter Series of Cloud Thermal Receipt Printers**
-
The [WooPrinter Series of Cloud Thermal Receipt Printers](https://hwgroup-bg.com/shop/) are capable of automatically or manually printing order data receipts from eCommerce platforms such as WooCommerce, Shopify and many more. 

Each Cloud Printer comes with a unique Cloud email address, the printer constantly monitors its email address, and once a email is received it gets printed (in the case of using Shopify the shop owner can automatically print order details for faster order processing). The WooPrinters are compatible with Shopify and this repository contains Documentation and resources for setting up the WooPrinter for automatic printing with Shopify.

When the user places an order in Shopify usually the shop owner receives a new order notification email, containing order details, and also customer details. In shopify the shop owner can define multiple recipients for the new order notifications as well as design his own email template for new order notification. In the case of using the WooPrinter Cloud Thermal Receipt printer, the shop owner configures the WooPrinter Cloud email address in the list of new order notification recipients. So when the customer places an order in Shopify an email is sent to the WooPrinter and its contents are printed automatically. Below is a link to a free email template for shopify, formatted for use with the WooPrinter Series of Cloud Thermal Receipt printers.
